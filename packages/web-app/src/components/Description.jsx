        You can access all lyrics without account login, just need to run the
        Spotify app while using it. The app will run minimized in the menu bar,
        allowing you to access the lyrics at any moment. Multiple options will
        let you configure the app interface and preferences as desired,
        accessing them by clicking the tray icon in the menu bar.

        The app is only available for macOS, new features and Windows support
        will be developed soon.
