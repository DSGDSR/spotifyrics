The app will run minimized in the menu bar, allowing you to access the lyrics at any moment. Multiple options will let you configure the app interface and preferences as desired, accesing them by clicking the tray icon in the menu bar.

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
